# Missing Migrants Visualization

## About the Data

This dataset is from the [Missing Migrants](https://www.kaggle.com/jmataya/missingmigrants) data uploaded to Kaggle, and contains information about people who have gone missing while travelling along migration routes.  This data originates from the [Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/).

The map data used in the right-hand legend is taken from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors), using the Land polygons dataset.  The shapefile was processed into sets of geodetic polygons
for use in the visualization.
